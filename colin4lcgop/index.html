  <div class="split-bio">
  <p>Attention Republican voters of Precinct 1-5 in Cheyenne, Wyoming! I am Colin Crossman, and <strong>I am asking for your vote</strong> to become your precinct committeeman. My leadership has been pivotal in helping the Laramie County GOP <a href="https://www.laramiecountygop.com/_files/ugd/f3ba83_d6cc22711a114bc28c743c518b044f2c.pdf">revitalize its bylaws</a>, ensuring they reflect our shared values and strengthen our local party. As a member of the Wyoming State GOP bylaws committee, <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/04/18/wyoming-gop-rejects-liz-cheney-amendment-to-kick-people-out-of-party/">I worked diligently to create fair and inclusive rules</a> that unite us rather than divide us.</p>
<p>I am a strong, principled, Constitutional conservative with a long history of First Amendment advocacy. I believe in the importance of fair party rules, recognizing that unfair rules will eventually be turned against those who advocated for them. My goal is to support and extend the conservative momentum within the Laramie County GOP without engaging in internal conflicts that only serve to divide us and benefit the Democrats.</p>
<p>Although I am a relative newcomer to Wyoming, having moved here in 2021 with my wife and two boys, I am deeply committed to preserving the amazing culture that drew us to this great state. I came here for the values and way of life that Wyoming represents, and I will work tirelessly to maintain and protect those ideals rather than trying to change them to reflect what I left behind.</p>
<p>Your support is crucial in this election. By voting for me, Colin Crossman, for precinct committeeman, you are choosing a leader who will fight for our conservative principles, advocate for fair and transparent rules, and work towards a united and strong Republican Party. Let&rsquo;s work together to secure a bright future for Wyoming and continue our conservative momentum.</p>
